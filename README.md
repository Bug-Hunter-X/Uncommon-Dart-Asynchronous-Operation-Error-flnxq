# Uncommon Dart Asynchronous Operation Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Dart when working with asynchronous operations.  The `doSomething` function simulates an asynchronous task. Calling it multiple times rapidly may lead to unhandled exceptions or unexpected behavior in the underlying async implementation, although the code itself is syntactically correct.

The solution provides a method to handle and mitigate this type of error.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart` using a Dart runtime environment.
3. Observe the behavior and any potential exceptions.

## Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.dart`) offers a more robust approach by managing the asynchronous operations efficiently, avoiding concurrency issues, or at least handling potential exceptions appropriately.
